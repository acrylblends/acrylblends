/**
 * The desktop shell: `npm run desktop` opens the app in a window. A frame app (`scripts/ide-host.mjs`) gets the whole ACRYL frame: the window attaches to the
 * frame host that runs for this folder, or starts it as `npm run dev` does (`frame.ts`, docs/plans/ide-host-inversion.md section 27). An app made before the frame
 * starts its own server in this Electron main process and opens one window on its address. Nothing in the app imports electron; every Electron call of the app
 * is in this file and `window.ts`, so a different shell is a change here only.
 *
 * Order matters: the user-data folder is set before anything else (and before the single-instance lock), so one app never shares window state, logs or the lock with
 * another app or with the real user's data.
