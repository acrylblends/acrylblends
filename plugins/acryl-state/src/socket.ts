/**
 * State over a WebSocket. A server-sent event stream holds one of the browser's six connections per host for as long as the page lives, and an app that follows a few keys in
 * several windows uses them all; a WebSocket is not one of those six, and one socket carries every key of a page.
 *
 * `GET /api/state/ws` upgrades. Up, one JSON message per frame: `{ "t": "sub", "key": "<key>" }` and `{ "t": "unsub", "key": "<key>" }`. Down: `{ "key": "<key>", "value": <json> }` once on
 * `sub` and after every change, `{ "key": "<key>", "error": "<why>" }` for a key that cannot be followed, and `{ "t": "ping" }` every {@link SOCKET_HEARTBEAT_MS} so a page can tell a quiet
 * socket from a dead one. `GET /api/state/client.js` is the browser module that speaks this (`watch(key, callback)`), with the event stream as its fallback.
 *
 * A WebSocket has no CORS, so the upgrade is checked here ({@link refuseStranger}): a loopback peer on this port with a loopback `Host`, and an `Origin` that, when the request has one,
 * is exactly this app's own origin. A program on this machine that sends no `Origin` (a script, a test) is let in, as it is for the JSON and stream routes; a web page of another
 * origin, and a name that only resolves to this machine (DNS rebinding), are not.
