/**
 * The built-in agent (spec 049 slice 14): a chat panel inside the running app. The person says what they want; the app's own agent (`driver: 'agent'`) or a coding
 * agent started in the app folder (`'claude'`, `'codex'`, `'pi'`) builds it through the door, and when a plugin was installed or removed the page reloads, so the new feature
 * shows with no restart. The drivers are entries of the `drivers` service this plugin provides (`drivers.ts`): chat drivers here, and other plugins (`driver-pty`) add more.
 *
 * - A middleware appends one script tag (`/api/agent-panel/panel.js`) to every HTML response of the routes mounted after it, so no page is edited.
 * - `GET /api/agent-panel/session` gives the page the drivers it may use and a token; `POST /api/agent-panel/ask` runs one message and answers server-sent events:
 *   `text`, `tool`, `change`, `done`, `error`.
 * - Only the app's own page may ask (a same-origin request carrying the token), one run at a time, and every ask is written to `.acryl/audit/agent-panel.jsonl`.
 * - Who asks (`visitors.ts`): in development one person, the owner, whose pages share one token and one run. As the Assistant each visitor has their own token, run and
 *   replay, named by an HttpOnly cookie: no visitor sees, follows or stops another's run, and the asks are bounded (per visitor per hour, per day, runs at once).
 * - The routes live under the app's mount: the root of the app's own server, or the frame's prefix (`/app`) when the frame hosts it, where the host's own
 *   `/api` routes would otherwise answer first. The row's `mount` config names it.
 * - Development only: the plugin does nothing with `NODE_ENV=production` or `ACRYL_DOOR=off`, except as the Assistant (`assistant: true`): then it runs in production too,
 *   docked open on the right, with the app's own agent only. The app gives that agent the page tools alone and a page-only door, so it uses the app for a visitor and
 *   cannot change it (src/app.ts, `ACRYL_ASSISTANT=on`). In the ACRYL frame's canvas the panel follows the frame's view: Build hides it, and Preview shows it only as
 *   the Assistant and only when the app's production environment names one (`assistantInProduction` in the session).
