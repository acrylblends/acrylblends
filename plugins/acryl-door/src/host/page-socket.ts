/**
 * The page channel over a WebSocket. An event stream (`page-routes.ts`) holds one of the browser's six connections per host for as long as the page lives; two windows of an app that
 * also stream their own state, with the panel following a run, use them all, and then no request of either window is sent (the door's answers, Stop). A WebSocket is not one of
 * those six: it opens at once however many streams are open, and the page's answers travel on it too, so nothing is queued behind a stream.
 *
 * `GET <prefix>/channel/ws?window=<id>&focused=0|1[&shell=<n>]` upgrades. The messages are the same JSON as the stream's: down, `{ "e": "call", "d": "<the call>" }` and
 * `{ "e": "ready" }` / `{ "e": "ping" }`; up, one {@link ChannelToHost} message per frame. A WebSocket has no CORS, so the `Origin` header is the boundary: it must be present and be
 * exactly this app's own origin, or the upgrade is refused (403) before any handshake. A page on another port, a web site, and a program that sends no `Origin` are all refused.
