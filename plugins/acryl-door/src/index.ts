/**
 * `acryl-door`: the Door of the five nouns, as a Cordis plugin of a framework app (spec 049 slice 9). An agent working in the app folder
 * looks at the running page, acts on it, and installs plugins live, through `.acryl/bin/acryl`; everything else it does with its own
 * file tools and shell.
 *
 * The page loads `/api/acryl-door/page.js` (one script tag) and keeps an event stream open to the Host; the Host sends it calls. An
 * operator on this machine reaches `/api/acryl-door/call` with the secret from `<app>/.acryl/door.json`. One effect owns the channel and
 * the audit, the routes are mounted after it, and a second effect writes the connection file last, so disposal removes the file first,
 * then the routes (their in-flight calls end), then closes the channel (every pending call settles).
