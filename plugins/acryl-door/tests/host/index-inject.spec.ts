/**
 * The seam the DSH host introduced: DSH's own index.html is not a framework route, so the door's page script reaches it through the web server's index-inject
 * hook (`tapIndex`). The tap is owned by the door's fiber: loading adds it once, unloading removes it, and with it the old activation's routes and secret (the
 * door file is gone and the operator face refuses what the old secret could read).
