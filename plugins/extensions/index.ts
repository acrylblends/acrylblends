/**
 * The extensions service (`ctx.extensions`): install, update, remove and reload Cordis plugins while the app runs.
 *
 * Extracted from ACRYL (`plugins/acryl-extension-context/lib/install.js`, `stage.js`, `reconcile.js`), where an agent-written plugin
 * installs, runs, updates and is removed live in the packaged app on macOS, Windows and Linux. ACRYL goes through pnpm and the Harness
 * Loader; here an extension is a folder with an `index.ts` (or `.js`) that exports a Cordis plugin, mounted as a child fiber of this
 * plugin. The rules carried over:
 *
 * - Check before changing anything; every answer is a structured result the agent can act on (`ok`, `stage`, `errors`, `next`).
 * - Stage a content-hashed copy and import it fresh, so an update runs new code without a restart (`stage.ts`).
 * - Import the new version while the old one still runs; dispose the old one only then. If the new one fails to start, mount the old
 *   one again (`restoredPrevious`), so a broken update never leaves the app without the version that worked.
 * - Report the real fiber state: `active`, `pending` (with the services it waits for) or `failed` (with the real error).
 * - One operation at a time, in order. A ledger line for every change (`ledger.ts`).
 * - At startup, reinstall what was installed; install new folders only from sources trusted to `install`, and only list the rest
 *   (ACRYL's trust rule: code that arrived through a `git pull` must not run until someone asks for it).
