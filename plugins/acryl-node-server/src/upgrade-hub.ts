/**
 * WebSocket upgrades for the Cordis adapters (spec 047 T009): one hub per HTTP transport. It owns the `ws` server (text and size limits, no compression), runs the ported
 * `setupWebSocket` on whatever emits `upgrade` events (a `node:http` server, or the Host web server's exact-path upgrade routes), pings every socket and ends the ones that stop
 * answering, and gives each mounting plugin an `upgradeWebSocket` whose accepted sockets belong to that plugin: when it unloads they are closed with 1001 within the grace, and
 * what is left is terminated. The handler sees `close` exactly once.
