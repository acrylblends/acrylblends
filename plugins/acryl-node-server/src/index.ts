/**
 * The framework's standalone HTTP adapter (spec 046, ported in spec 047), the standalone counterpart of the Host adapter. It owns one
 * `node:http` server built by the ported adapter in `src/adapter/` and hands every request to `ctx.router.fetch`, with the socket's peer
 * address and local port as connection facts.
 * Use it in an app that runs without the ACRYL Host; inside the Host, `acryl-router-http` mounts prefixes on the Host's own web server.
 * One adapter per runtime: a plugin keeps asking `ctx.inject(['routerHttp'], ...)` for a mount, which simply never fires here, because this
 * adapter serves the whole router.
 *
 * A configured port that is taken is followed by the next free one, at most `scan` further ports; port 0 lets the system choose. A port a
 * browser refuses to open (`RESTRICTED_PORTS`) is skipped like a taken one. Disposal ends open streams, closes every connection and returns
 * once the port is free.
