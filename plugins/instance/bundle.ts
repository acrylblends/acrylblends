/**
 * The Program and the person's source as one app tree (specs/049-framework-architecture/app-storage.md in ACRYL, slice 3). A desktop product ships the
 * Program in its bundle, read-only and replaced by every update: the framework's plugins, the generated host and the frame's packages. An app's
 * `source` holds only what is the person's. Their files still name the framework the way every app does (`../plugins/acryl-router/src/index.ts`,
 * `acrylblends`), so the module resolver serves the tree from both places: a Program path from the bundle, anything else from the source.
 *
 * Framework packages resolve from the bundle FIRST, for any importer outside it: a package the person added that carries its own `acrylblends` or
 * `@deepseek-ai/cordis` still gets the bundle's, because two framework copies in one process break it (the `matchedRoutes` 500). Any other package
 * resolves as Node resolves it, from the source's own `node_modules` (what the person added), with the bundle's as the fallback.
 *
 * `NODE_PATH` does not reach ESM; the seam is `registerHooks`, which covers `import`, `require` and `require.resolve` alike. `bundle-overlay.ts`
 * registers it, first, in a product's frame host. Pure apart from `readProduct`.
