/**
 * Push and pull for the checked-out branch, the Git tab's "share through git". The Host owns every git call; the client only calls the routes.
 *
 * - The remote is the branch's own (`branch.<name>.remote`), else `origin`, else the only remote. Several remotes and none named `origin` is
 *   refused plainly rather than guessed.
 * - Push sends the branch to its upstream, and on the first push sets it (`--set-upstream`). It is never forced: a remote that has moved on is
 *   said so before git is even asked. It sends work under the person's name, so it is planned first (what, where, to which address) and sends
 *   only the plan the person confirmed, read again just before; a plan that changed meanwhile sends nothing.
 * - Pull fetches, then fast-forwards only. A branch that has moved on both here and there is left exactly as it is, with a sentence that says so.
 * - Every failure carries git's own line (the runner's `detail`): no remote, a refused login, a network that is down.
 *
 * Push and pull run one at a time: a second click waits for the first to finish rather than racing it.
