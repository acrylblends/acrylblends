/**
 * Which chats are real, and what each is called. A chat is real when it has at least one turn. DSH's session list marks a chat `blank` only while it is
 * loaded and carries no title for one that is not, so the list alone cannot tell an old empty chat from a used one or name it; the Host reads each
 * session's log once for both: a `turn/start`, and the title (DSH's own `session/title` event, else the person's first message, cut short).
 * A chat with a title DSH or the person gave is final; one named from its first message is read again after a while, since DSH's title may follow.
