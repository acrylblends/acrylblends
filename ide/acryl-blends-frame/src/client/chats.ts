 * `sessions/main-session.ts`); without it, the frame holds the main-view reference itself.
 *
 * Which branch a chat belongs to, and which chats are open, is the branch-chats record (`./branch-chats.ts`), the one source of truth. The rule this
 * store keeps: the chat on screen always belongs to the checked-out branch (docs/design/blends-frame-mockup.html, scenarios 2 and 5). Whatever
 * moves the folder to another branch - the left panel, the New button, the Git tab, a terminal - the chat on screen then becomes that branch's own
 * (`decideChat`). A chat is open while it has a tab or is on screen: the left panel lists only those, and the rest are closed, found in History.
