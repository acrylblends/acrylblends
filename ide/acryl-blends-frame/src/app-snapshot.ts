 * The app's snapshot verbs as the frame's service `appSnapshot`: every version the frame saves (Save point, the auto-save) is captured first, so
 * a version is always a snapshot whose `blend.yaml` names every plugin folder and whose lock matches; the agent's snapshot tools
 * (acryl-app-context) and the left panel's Push and Pull run on it too, the same code as `npm run snapshot`. The verbs are the app's own (`plugins/manifest/snapshot.ts`, part of the app's
 * folder), so the frame runs the version the app was made with; an app made before them says so instead of guessing. Push and pull are the Git
 * tab's (./git-sync.ts): a version goes to the branch's remote and comes back from it, never forced.
