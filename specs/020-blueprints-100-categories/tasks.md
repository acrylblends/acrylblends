# 020 - Tasks

One task per category, in the site's order (`src/lib/content.ts` in acrylblends.github.io). Each task is one blueprint that meets "Done for one
blueprint" in spec.md. The idea is a starting point: a builder may pick a better one inside the same category and records why in the task line.
Ten tasks make one batch, and one batch is one cloud-agent session (cloud-brief.md).

Format: `T<nnn> [B<batch>] <category> (subcategories) - acrylblends.<name>: <the app>`.

## Setup (done by the coordinator before batch 1)

- [ ] T000 The registry path works end to end with one real blueprint: `acrylblends.system-monitor` made, published to
  `registry/blends/` in acrylblends.github.io with `make-entry.mjs`, `index.json` regenerated, and started again with
  `npm create acrylblends@latest t -- --from acrylblends.system-monitor --registry <checkout>`. The steps that worked go into cloud-brief.md.
