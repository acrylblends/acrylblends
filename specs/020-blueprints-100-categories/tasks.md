# 020 - Tasks

One task per category, in the site's order (`src/lib/content.ts` in acrylblends.github.io). Each task is one blueprint that meets "Done for one
blueprint" in spec.md. The idea is a starting point: a builder may pick a better one inside the same category and records why in the task line.
Ten tasks make one batch, and one batch is one cloud-agent session (cloud-brief.md).

Format: `T<nnn> [B<batch>] <category> (subcategories) - acrylblends.<name>: <the app>`.

## Setup (done by the coordinator before batch 1)

- [x] T000 The registry path works end to end with one real blueprint: `acrylblends.system-monitor` made, published to
  `registry/blends/` in acrylblends.github.io with `make-entry.mjs`, `index.json` regenerated, and started again with
  `npm create acrylblends@latest t -- --from acrylblends.system-monitor --registry <checkout>`. The steps that worked go into cloud-brief.md. (Done 2026-11-04: site branch `blueprints/batch-01`; the brief is the steps as run.)

## Found

Things a builder ran into that the CLI, the framework or the registry should fix (one line each, with the task that found it).
- T001: `make-entry.mjs` wrote into `workshop-registry/blends/` of this repository and always set `category: workshop`; it now takes `--out <registry folder>` and `--category <slug>` (tested in workshop-registry/test/rules.test.mjs).
- T001: `blend.yaml`'s `metadata` has no field for a subcategory (the format refuses unknown keys), so the spec's "subcategory set in the entry" cannot be done there. The site's taxonomy placement is a hand-written line in `src/lib/registry-placement.ts` (site repository), by display names; an entry without one is not shown on the site.
- T001: `scripts/registry-index.ts` in the site repository imports `registry.ts` from a checkout of the private ACRYL repo (CI pins a commit). The published `@webboxes/blends-core@0.4.0` has the same code as `dist/registry.js` and no `src/`; a two-line shim (cloud-brief.md, "Once") makes the script run on it, with Node 24 or bun, and it reproduces the existing `index.json` byte for byte. A cloud agent has no other way to run it.
- T001: every batch branch appends a line to `registryPlacement` and an entry to `registry/index.json`, so merging the ten branches conflicts there; after merging, regenerate the index (`node scripts/registry-index.ts registry`) instead of resolving it by hand, and keep every placement line.
- T001: `npm run dev` in a blank-template app is `node --watch` (the app alone). "Serves the app inside the frame" in spec.md's "Done for one blueprint" (3) is therefore not something a cloud agent can check; the brief leaves the frame to the coordinator. The system-monitor was not opened in the frame in T000.
- T001: the made app starts with `package-lock.json` after `npm install`; `make-entry.mjs` carries it into the entry (kept: it makes the entry's install repeatable).
- T001: `npm create acrylblends@latest` printed "Next: see the template's README" for an app made from a registry entry; harmless, not changed.
- T011-T020: `npm create acrylblends@latest` still scaffolds the 1.1.0 template; batch 2 used `npx --yes acrylblends@1.2.1 init <dir> --template blank --yes`, the shape of 02/03 (home, extensions, acryl-door, app plugin folders).
- T011-T020: the full registry is past the CLI's one-template file limit, so each entry was proved from a one-entry scratch registry (copy the entry into `R/blends`, run the site's `registry-index.ts R`, then `npm create ... --registry R`). All ten installed, passed their tests and served their first page.
- T011-T020: every suite pins `process.env.TZ = 'UTC'` in `test/support.ts` and also passes under America/Los_Angeles and Asia/Tokyo.
- T011-T020: `make-entry.mjs` carries `docs/screenshot.png`; each listing was checked on a built site at `/blends/<category>/<subcategory-slug>` and `/blends/b/<id>`.
- T011-T020: `plugin.json` is still not written by the CLI template or `make-entry`; each feature plugin got one by hand, and each app has the switch-off test.
- T011: `design/repos.md` gives the id `acrylblends.vulnerability-tracker`, but the spec and the batch's own naming use `acrylblends.vuln-tracker`; the spec wins after the rework, so the app id, the lock origin and the registry entry are `acrylblends.vuln-tracker` (the repository folder stays `11-vulnerability-tracker`).
- T013/T014: the mockups load Unsplash images; the reworked apps draw deterministic SVG artwork instead (albums, materials, architecture, window light), so the tests, the 1440x900 screenshot and the site card need no network.
- T016/T017/T018: the industrial, robotics and IoT apps are record/simulation surfaces only. No PLC, robot controller or sensor is contacted; the sensor app ingests through a local HTTP endpoint with unit validation.
- T015: the mockup's static converter prints 8,469.8 psi while its own script computes 8,470.2 for 58.4 MPa. The app stores the series average as 58.3972 MPa: the card shows 58.4 and the initial result 8,469.8, while typing 58.4 and converting gives 8,470.2, so both mockup numbers are true.
- T011-T020 rework: every app was compared side by side with its mockup at 1440x900 after the first review; the mockup and app images, a difference list with each remaining difference justified, and a spec-coverage table with the proving test are under WORK/proof/<n>-<name>/ (WORK = `_testfield/batch01`).
- T011-T020 rework: the mockup's headline numbers are real data now (4,281 photos, 128 findings, 36 active links, 6.4 h downtime, 4,320 readings/hour, 486:35 flight time), and every app has one page plugin per screen with its own plugin.json and switch-off test.
- T011-T020 rework: test counts are 26 (11), 16 (12), 23 (13), 26 (14), 25 (15), 16 (16), 17 (17), 13 (18), 16 (19), 17 (20); all pass under UTC, America/Los_Angeles and Asia/Tokyo.
- T011-T020 rework: `make-entry.mjs` skips any folder named `data`, so the lab notebook's data plugin had to be named `data-table`; the entry now carries it. A folder name that collides with a skip rule should be a refusal, not a silent omission.
- T011-T020 rework: every entry carries `blend.lock.json` captured after the last edit, and the registry entry and the app repository were diffed clean (excluding design, .git, node_modules and the `.gitignore` to `gitignore` rename `make-entry` does).
- T011-T020 rework: the SITE branch was rebased onto 0f4a59c (portability CI) and every entry passes `registry-index --check` with blends-core 0.5.0; the 12 Link Shortener suite was expanded from 12 to 16 tests at the coordinator's request.
- T011-T020 fix: the first review caught unstyled native controls (the maintenance register's `<select>` and rows, the flight logbook's two filter selects). They are now styled with `appearance:none` and the page's chip look; the register is block rows in a 315px scroll panel (five rows) with the amber selected border. The screenshots and the proof difference lists were regenerated.
