# Agents

A coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Copilot and others) builds on Acryl best when the documentation is in the folder it works in. A project created with
`npm create acrylblends@latest` (and one made with `npx acrylblends init`) therefore contains:

- `docs/framework/`: these pages. Start at `README.md`; `api/summary.md` is the one-page summary of the API.
- `AGENTS.md`: where the API is, how a feature is built (an `Acryl` app mounted with `ctx.router.route`, a plugin registered in `src/app.ts` and `blend.yaml`, a state cell),
  the defaults and how each is swapped, the things that surprise people, and what must pass before a task is done (`npm test` and `npm run check`).
- `CLAUDE.md`: the same text as `AGENTS.md`, so tools that read either file read the same guide.
- One skill, `app-guide`, in `.claude/skills/app-guide/SKILL.md` and `.agents/skills/app-guide/SKILL.md` (the same text): where to read first, the one plugin folder, the defaults, the door, and what "done" means.
- `.gitignore` lists `.acryl/`, the folder the door keeps its secret and state in, so `git add -A` stages none of it.

## One plugin folder

Every plugin of an app is a folder in `plugins/<name>/`, at the root of the app: the library plugins `acrylblends add <name>` copies (listed in `plugins/library.json`), and the
plugins you or an agent write. There is no `src/plugins/` and no `extensions/`. An app made before this layout keeps working for one release: the CLI reads its `src/plugins/` and
`extensions/` and warns; move them with `git mv src/plugins plugins`, fix the paths in `tsconfig.json`, `package.json` and `src/`, and `git mv extensions/<name> plugins/<name>`.

## Defaults, and how to swap each

The framework is not rigid: every choice is a plugin behind a port, and the default is only a fallback. A new app names each default in `AGENTS.md`: records on the `db` port
with SQLite, small state on the `kv` port with one JSON file, the Node server, the browser as the window (`acrylblends add desktop` adds Electron), browser code through
`clientModules`. A swap changes the one file that opens or mounts the choice (the opener, `src/db.ts`; or `src/app.ts` in a Blend app), because nothing else imports a provider
(`acrylblends check-deps` checks it). An outside tool, such as a database server or a bundler, joins the app as a provider in `plugins/<name>/` that implements the port.

## What an agent can do inside a running app

The `agent` template (a Cordis app; `acryl-app` is its old name and still works) also lets an agent change the app while it runs:

1. The agent writes a plugin into `plugins/<name>/index.ts`. The plugin may import `acrylblends` and the other subpaths by name.
2. The app installs it as a child plugin, runs its `check(ctx)` with the plugin's own context, and keeps the previous version if the new one fails to start or to pass its check.
3. A plugin's routes are an `Acryl` app mounted with `ctx.router.route`, so removing the plugin removes its routes.

See [Acryl in a Cordis app](../cordis/acryl-in-a-cordis-app.md), [Plugin lifecycle](../cordis/plugin-lifecycle.md) and [Mounting](../cordis/mounting.md).

## The agent panel and the terminals

The panel is a chat button on every page of the running app. **A new app from the `agent` template has it** (`npm create acrylblends@latest my-app agent`), and `driver-pty` adds real terminals to it. Both are **development only** (see [what runs in production](../guides/production.md)).

```sh
npm create acrylblends@latest my-app agent
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev          # the panel is the button at the corner of the page
npx acrylblends add driver-pty   # optional: real terminals (pty:claude, pty:codex, pty:pi) in the panel
npm install
```

- The panel needs the `agent` and `extensions` rows, which only the `agent` template has: `add agent-panel` on an app without them (a `blank` app) refuses before it copies anything and says which rows are missing, and on an `agent` app it says the panel is already there. An agent-template app made before 1.0.5 gets it with `npx acrylblends add agent-panel`.
- `add driver-pty` puts the driver's row after the panel's in `blend.yaml` and registers it in `src/app.ts`.
- A **run belongs to the app, not to the page**: when the page reloads (the door reloads it after a plugin change) the panel shows the question and the events so far and follows the run to its end; **Stop** is the only thing that cancels it.
- **The panel's coding agents are yours.** `claude`, `codex` and `pi` run on the machine that runs the app, in the app folder, with the login of the person who started it: `claude` and `codex` use their own signed-in sessions, and `pi` is offered when `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is set or `pi` has stored a DeepSeek login (`~/.pi/agent/auth.json`, read from the `HOME` of the process that runs the app: an app started under another `HOME` does not see the login, and the panel then lists `pty:pi` but no chat `pi`). A program that is not installed, or is not logged in, is not offered; nothing is shared between machines, and a workshop laptop needs its own login. The panel's own `agent` (the offline scripted one) needs none.
- `pi` has to be an executable on the `PATH`; a shell function that wraps the binary is fine as long as the binary itself is found by `which pi`.
- `driver-pty` brings `node-pty`, which ships prebuilt binaries for macOS, Windows and Linux. npm 11 and pnpm warn that its install script was not run (they ask you to approve dependency install scripts); you can ignore the warning. If no `pty:` terminal is offered and the app prints why at start, approve and rebuild: `npm approve-scripts node-pty`, then `npm rebuild node-pty` (pnpm: `pnpm approve-builds`).

## Checking that an agent can use the docs

The repository has a manual gate: it creates a fresh app, starts a headless coding agent inside it with a one-line task (for example "add a /customers/count route with a test"),
and checks that the app's tests and type-check pass afterwards and that the route answers.
