# Slice 1 against ACRYL's own desktop: the frame comparison, first run

Date: 2026-10-30. Candidate: a fresh `boot` app on the integrated slice-1 branches (`101-ide-slice1-integration`), its DSH profile created by the app's own script, booted with a throwaway DSH home. Reference: `scripts/frame-reference`, ACRYL Desktop at 37f4dd9c.

Run (the app kept by the boot gate, then restarted by hand on its own home):

```sh
VERIFY_KEEP=1 pnpm run verify:ide-profile
# in the kept app folder, with DSH_HOME and ACRYLBLENDS_HOME as the gate set them:
npm run dev
node scripts/frame-compare.mjs check scripts/frame-reference "<url with token>" /tmp/framecmp --max 2
```

None of the 18 views is within 2% yet. The comparison is still useful: it shows exactly what differs and why.

## What matches

Settings > Shortcuts at 3-4% (image beside the reference: [frame-compare-settings-shortcuts.png](frame-compare-settings-shortcuts.png)): the same sections, rows, shortcuts, toggles and layout, offset only because the frame's left column shows different content (below). Settings renders in ACRYL's frame, not a look-alike.

## What differs, and where each difference belongs

1. **DSH's first-run dialogs still cover the frame.** The `frame` views show "Add an API key to get started" over the main surface: the view steps click "Configure later", but the dialog reappears after the click in this build, so the screenshot catches it. Slice 1's own list has "first run without DSH's two dialogs in the way"; that is not done yet.
2. **The left column's content.** The reference shows Projects and Workspaces with a project row; the candidate shows DSH's session list (New Session, Plugins, Default workspace). Projects and the workspace are slice 2 (`acryl-workspace`); until then the frame is right and its content is not.
3. **The main surface.** The reference's conversation area is ACRYL's, the candidate's is DSH's conversation UI: that is the intended composition (the chat is DSH's), so those pixels will never match by design. A strict whole-page comparison of `frame*` is the wrong gate; the gate should compare the frame chrome (panels, Settings) and accept the chat surface as the design.
4. **Right panel and terminals** do not exist yet (slice 2), so two views have no candidate.

## What would make the gate meaningful at slice 1

- Suppress DSH's first-run dialogs in the profile the generator writes (a settings-models row config, not a page hack), then re-run the `frame` views.
- Add a mask for the main-surface region to `frame-views.json`, or a `--views` subset (left-panel-collapsed, settings-*) so slice 1's gate measures what slice 1 adds.
- Keep the full set for slice 2, when projects, the right panel and terminals exist.
