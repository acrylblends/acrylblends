# Sharing a plugin between people: the `plugin-share` plugin

Spec: `specs/049-framework-architecture/tasks.md` M11 (T009, T011, T015) in acryldev/acryl. This note is the Cordis mini-design; `plugin pull` comes first.

## 1. Capability and boundary

`plugin-share` turns a release someone published into a running plugin in this app, and later publishes one. It is its own plugin because it has its own lifecycle and is left out of production, as the builder is. Extensions keeps owning the install transaction (`install`, rollback, ledger): pull hands it a folder and never mounts anything itself.

Fetching and unpacking belong to `@webboxes/plugin-hub`, the digest and the portability rules to `@webboxes/blends-core`. Neither is copied.

## 2. Provides and consumes

- Provides the service `pluginShare`: `pull(source)` answers `{ ok: true, name, version, integrity, digest, action, state }` or `{ ok: false, refusal, reason, next }`.
- `inject: ['extensions', 'appInstance']`. A service the pulled plugin needs is looked up with `ctx.get`, by name, at the moment of the pull.
- The door reaches it through `ctx.get('pluginShare')` and its own port, as it does for `extensions`: the verb `plugin-pull { source }`, the CLI `plugin pull <source>`.

## 3. Effects and disposal

A pull holds nothing after it answers. Its scratch store is removed on every path, including a thrown error. The plugin has no timers, routes or subscriptions. Pulls run one at a time, so two pulls of one name cannot race for its folder.

## 4. Configuration and composition

Row id `plugin-share`, equal to the package name; mounted after `extensions`. Config: `dir` (where pulled plugins go, the extensions source, default `<root>/plugins`) and `releases` (the `ReleasePort`, default GitHub over HTTPS; a test passes a local fixture).

## 5. Events and durability

No event of its own. It listens to the event extensions emits on every change: a removal takes the plugin's record out. A pull's durable fact is its record in the `plugin-share` row's `config.pulled` of `blend.yaml`: source, sha512 and digest. A row's config is resolved into `blend.lock.json`, so the lock records it with no new format. At a start, a recorded plugin whose folder is gone is fetched again by its digest and sha512; other bytes are refused and the record stays. A local `.tgz` names nothing another machine could fetch, so it is not recorded and the answer says so.

## 6. The order of a pull

Everything up to step 5 runs in memory or in the scratch store, so a refusal has nothing to undo, and no code of the plugin has run.

1. Read the source. `github:` and a `.tgz` path or address are accepted, anything else is refused by name. `@sha256:<digest>` at the end names the content digest. A relative `.tgz` path is read from the app folder.
2. `pullPlugin` into a scratch store: the release's single `.tgz`, its sha512, the version against the tag.
3. `readTarball`, then the pure checks in `pull-check.ts`, in this order: a name the extensions folder can hold; the named digest; `portabilityIssues`; no `dependencies` (nothing is installed, so they could not resolve); an entry file; every service in its literal `inject` present in this app.
4. If `plugins/<name>/` exists: the same digest counts as already there, a different one is refused, so a person's edits are never overwritten.
5. Write to `plugins/.pulling-<name>/`, rename to `plugins/<name>/`, call `extensions.install`.
6. An install that fails or stays pending removes what step 5 wrote, so the app is as it was.

Service names are read from the source with `hostInjectFromSource`, never with `readServiceContract`, whose fallback imports the plugin: a stranger's code does not run to find out whether it may run. A computed `inject` is refused for that reason. Step 6 catches what a literal cannot say.

Known limit: an object-form `inject` lists every key as needed, so a plugin marking a service optional there is refused when the service is absent, and the reason names the service.

An agent can call the verb, as it can already write and install a plugin. Pull gives it no new power. Publish does, so it waits for a person.

## Publishing

`planPublish(name)` packages the plugin and answers the account, repository, version, license, files, sha512, digest and the pull line, sending nothing. The package already names its repository and license, so the bytes planned are the bytes released. `publish(name, confirmed)` makes the plan again and sends nothing if it differs.

The verb `plugin-publish` answers only the plan. A yes comes from a prompt in the person's own terminal, or from Share in the frame. Its route is not a verb, so MCP and the chat do not have it. It takes this run's door secret, so this keeps honest agents from publishing by accident; it is not a wall against code on this machine.

License: MIT by default, in the same line as the account, repository and version, and `--license <id>` changes it before the yes.

## Verification

Real Cordis activation in `plugins/plugin-share/test/`: a pull from a local release fixture, with its route answering without a restart; each refusal changes nothing on disk or in the running app; pulling twice; the service leaving with its fiber. The hub's sha512 and tar parsing keep their own tests.

## Every template that installs live (T020)

Spec 049 T020: a framed blank, notes, chat or nodejs app refuses the pull, and the Blank DMG is a framed blank app. plugin-share becomes a row of every template that has an extensions row.

- **The blocker is one import.** plugin-share imports `packagePlugin` from `builder/package.ts`, so its `plugin.json` requires builder, and builder requires agent and sandbox. `package.ts` imports only `@webboxes/blends-core` and `@webboxes/plugin-hub`, nothing of builder. It moves to `plugins/plugin-share/package.ts`. Builder's `package_plugin` tool imports it from there and requires plugin-share. The dependency then points from the agent's tool to the sharing capability, never back.
- **`requires` after the move:** plugin-share requires `instance`, `extensions` and `manifest`. It imports `extensions`' name rule and `manifest`'s lock writer, and it injects `extensions` and `appInstance`. Every one of the four templates carries all three.
- **The rows.** Blank, notes, chat and nodejs gain the row after `extensions` in `blend.yaml`, the registry entry and `'plugin-share': { dir }` in `src/app.ts`, and the name in `template.json`. In production the row is left out, as the agent template does, because a pull runs a stranger's code.
- **The frame.** Nothing changes. `frame-rows.ts` already keeps `pluginShare` out of the isolate list, so the door reaches it in every framed template.
- **todo has no extensions row**, so it has nothing to install into. It keeps the refusal, and the refusal names that.
- **The DMG** is built from 127-blank-dmg by `init --template blank --desktop`. It gets the row when that branch takes main.
- **Verification:** the framed pull step of `verify-ide-template` runs for blank too, which `check` already runs, so the gate covers the DMG's template. The packed gate checks every template's `npm run check`.

## The rule each book decided

- **Clean Architecture:** the checks are pure policy over plain files, and the door depends on a port it declares, not on this plugin.
- **Clean Code:** one reason per refusal, each with a name and a next step.
- **A Philosophy of Software Design:** one deep call, `pull(source)`. "Already there" is defined as success, not as an error for callers to handle.
- **DDD Distilled:** one language with the hub and the registry: source, release, integrity (the tarball's sha512), digest (the content's sha256), refusal.
- **The Pragmatic Programmer:** crash early, before a byte reaches `plugins/`; DRY, the hub and blends-core are dependencies, not copies.
