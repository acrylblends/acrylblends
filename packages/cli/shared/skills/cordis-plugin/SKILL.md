description: Add a Cordis plugin to __APP_NAME__ - a plugins/<name>/ folder with name, inject, apply and an optional check, its routes as an Acryl app, how to mount it in blend.yaml and src/app.ts or install it live through the door, and how to verify it. Use when a feature should be its own plugin, or when asked to extend the app.

# Adding a Cordis plugin

A plugin is a folder `plugins/<name>/` with an `index.ts` exporting `name` (its id), `inject` (the services it needs) and `apply(ctx)`. Everything it acquires belongs to one `ctx.effect(...)`, so unloading the plugin or stopping the app releases it.

```ts
import type { Context } from '@deepseek-ai/cordis'
import { Acryl } from 'acrylblends'

export const name = 'due-dates'
export const inject = ['router']

export function apply(ctx: Context): void {
  const app = new Acryl().get('/due-dates', (c) => c.json({ ok: true }))
  ctx.router.route('/due-dates', app)
}
```

- **Routes** are an `Acryl` app mounted with `ctx.router.route('/due-dates', app)`; removing the plugin removes them. Write the app's own path: the frame that hosts the app in development adds its canvas prefix, so the same route answers `/due-dates` under `npm start` and `/app/due-dates` in the canvas. Never put the frame's prefix in a plugin's route. Import the framework by name (`acrylblends`, `acrylblends/body-limit`, `acryl-router`); a row's relative imports of its sibling plugins also work.
- **State** lives in cells: `ctx.state.cell('due-dates.tasks', [])`. A page follows one with `watch` from `/api/state/client.js`, never with an `EventSource`, and never by polling what `watch` already pushes.
- **Two ways in.** A plugin the app keeps: add a row to `blend.yaml` (`- id: <name>` and `name: <name>`) and import it in the `registry` of `src/app.ts`. A plugin installed while the app runs: `.acryl/bin/acryl plugin add plugins/<name>` (the `extensions` row loads it again at every start). The app keeps the previous version when a live install fails to start or fails its `check(ctx)`.
- **Check it.** `npm test` and `npm run check` must pass. With the app running, use the door: `.acryl/bin/acryl look` reads the page as text with refs and `acryl act ...` acts on it; an install or reload shows the new feature in the page.
